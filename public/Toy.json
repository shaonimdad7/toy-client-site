        "description": "My doll had the best of ideas out there in the wild garden. We would talk, her and I. As I grew up I could tell that those around me had lost that abiltiy, that their dolls had become silent. But not me. I can still talk with them, hear what they have to say. Maybe my dolls are my angel voices, maybe it is they who love to play so much, play and guide."

As cold and limp as a lifeless child and, yet, as alive in my thoughts as any lurking creature that wishes to carefully feast upon every last inch of me....starting with the fear it tastes in every corner of my soul."
